# GraphQL [ future ]

GraphQL is getting more and more popular and it presents yet another way to _type_ your schema definitions. I'd like to add a module to **Firemodel** which seemlessly exports/integrates with the GraphQL schema definitions but haven't found the time yet (plus I'm definitely not a GraphQL expert).

If you're interested in helping me with this consider me very interested.
