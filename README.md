## Contributing 

I have developed this module selfishly for my own needs but as with all my other open-source work I'd be happy to recieve PR's and issues. Not surprisingly, PR's are my preference but sometimes people don't feel they have the right skills or time to fix something they feel is broken so raising issues is a nice way to communicate something you've noticed. I can't promise issues will always get immediate attention but I will get back as soon as I can.
